<h3>My long-term goal and or career pathway</h3>
<p>Ideally I would like to find employment as a junior web developer when I finish the EDA course. I'm new to IT but I have always been interested in having a career in this industry because it's fast-paced and requires a lot of problem-solving.</p>
<h3>Skills I want to develop at EDA?</h3>
<p>Mostly technical skills. I've been working for about 22 years so I feel like my non-technical skills are pretty solid as I've had a lot of experience working with different people from different backgrounds. However, I am always open to learning new things and I'm looking forward to the 'core skills' part of the course. I am also enjoying the weekly sprint reflections more than I thought I would because it helps to regularly reflect on achievements and setbacks.</p>
<h3>My commitment to how I will manage my workload at EDA. </h3>
<p>This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>
<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>  
<p>More to come!</p>
