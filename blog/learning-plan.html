        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        A description of your own strengths and limitations
        Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
        A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
        For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.
        These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
        You and your facilitator will discuss your learning plan in the next check-in</p>
