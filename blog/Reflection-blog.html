<h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
<p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is a sensitivity to the needs of others and ourselves. The recognition that anger, sadness, and various other outbursts can be a sign that something deeper is going on with others or ourselves.</p>

<p>Those who have a high EQ usually recognise that some emotions are a ‘mask’ for others - sometimes feeling of hate are really feelings of love.</p>
                
<P>Emotional Intelligence is not something you are born with, it’s something you learn, and it’s something that most people can improve on. Improving on your EQ involves learning how to interpret your own feelings and knowing where they come from, and how or past shapes who are are today.</P>
                
<p>I recently started reading the book Unf**ck Yourself by Gary Bishop. He argues that the only barrier to living our best lives is ourselves and that we need to work on controlling our thoughts (the average person has about fifty thousand thoughts a day!) Bishop also argues that “... although we have little control or no say in automatic and reactionary thoughts, we have a massive say in which of those thoughts we attach significance to. They don’t come preloaded”.</p>
<div class="quote">     
“If human emotions largely result from thinking, then one may appreciably control one’s feelings by controlling one’s thoughts - or by changing the internalised sentences, or self-talk, with which one largely created the feeling in the first place”. - Gary Bishop</div>
                
 <p>So a lot of changing how we think, or how we control our subconscious thoughts can change the structure of our brain, or something that scientists call ‘neuroplasticity’. Bishop states that “...the easiest way to shape those thoughts is through conscious decisive self-talk. The kind of talk that “cuts through” and takes control of your life.</p>
                
<p>Just like the regular lifting of weights at the gym builds muscle memory, the process of regularly assessing your negative thoughts and making the conscious choice to put them aside and/or replace them with positive ones creates changes to the brain’s neural pathways.</p>

<h2>My core values</h2>
<p>I feel very fortunate to have grown up in New Zealand, especially in a multi-cultural environment such as ours. What I like the most about my upbringing is that I was able to be educated, and have been able to work and socialise with people from many different backgrounds. The ability to see things from different points of view and to develop self-awareness, and an awareness of others, is probably one of the most important attributes that a person can have.</p>
 <h2>Strengths and weaknesses</h2>
 <p>Over the course of my career I have done many personality and strengths/weaknesses tests. The test that I identified and learned the most about myself from was the Myers-Briggs test. My profile result was INFJ (Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judgment). Famous people that share my INFJ personality type are Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, and Plato!</p>
<p>One of the strengths of my personality, and something that was identified in the Myers-Briggs test, is my ability to be decisive. When I make up my mind about something, it's full-stream ahead and I'm able to see things through with conviction. My previous work experience has involved a lot of contract and fixed-term positions, so the ability to be decisive on the job has allowed for me to successfully deliver on many projects and meet tight deadlines.</p>
<p>My other strengths are my ability to be determined and passionate about what I believe in. If I don't think something is fair or reasonable to others, or myself, then I am not affraid to challenge it, or at least propose some alternative solutions that try to capture differing viewpoints. </p>
<p>A weakness is that I can be rather sensitive and not particularly good at taking criticism. I think that taking on a lot of contract work has helped me to address this weakness because I've often been in situations where I know nothing about the subject matter. This has placed me on huge learning-curves where I have had to remain open to critique from managers and other staff in order for me to deliver high-quality work. For example, I recently had to write a Business Case that proposed possible solutions for the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain - a subject I knew nothing about, and I made some mistakes along that way! I think it's important to have humility and feel comfortable with not knowing everything about a certain subject, as long as you remain open to learning and comfortable with building new working relationships quickly in order to find answers and solutions.</p>
