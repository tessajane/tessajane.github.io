 <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
    <div><img src="tech1.jpeg"></div>
    <h3>Margins</h3> 
    <p>Margins create invisable space around a box that nothing else can go in. They create this space without background colour. Margins push away empty space from the box.<br>
    <h3>Borders</h3>
    <p>Borders in CSS are similar to borders in MS Office in that they create a visable line/border around a box. You can also add borders to only one, two, or three sides of the box. You can also change the thickness of the borders. There are three different border properties in CSS:
   <div class="parentcontainer">
   <ul>
      <li>border-width</li>
      <li>border-color</li>
      <li>border-style</li>   
   </ul>
   </div>
    <h2>Padding</h2>
    <p>Padding and margins behave in a similar way, which often confuses people. The best way to understand the difference between padding and margins is that margins create invisable space around the box while padding creates space that includes the background colour. Obviously you would need to have background colour in order to see what the padding is doing in your browser.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that you need to add up the width, margin, border, and padding space to know the total space that the box is taking up on the webpage. If you want to add an additional box to the right or left of your box then you may not have enough space, and this will push the second box below the first box.</p>
